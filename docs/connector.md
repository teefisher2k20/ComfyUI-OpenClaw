# OpenClaw Connector

The **OpenClaw Connector** (`connector`) is a standalone process that allows you to control your local ComfyUI instance remotely via chat platforms like **Telegram**, **Discord**, **LINE**, **WhatsApp**, **WeChat Official Account**, **KakaoTalk (Kakao i Open Builder)**, **Slack**, and **Feishu/Lark**.

## How It Works

The connector runs alongside ComfyUI on your machine.

1. It connects outbound to Telegram/Discord (polling/gateway).
2. LINE/WhatsApp/WeChat/KakaoTalk/Slack use inbound webhooks (HTTPS required), while Feishu/Lark can run in webhook mode or long-connection mode with a separate callback ingress path for interactive actions.
3. It talks to ComfyUI via `localhost`.
4. It relays commands and status updates securely.

**Security**:

- **Transport Model**: Telegram/Discord are outbound. LINE/WhatsApp/WeChat/KakaoTalk/Slack require inbound HTTPS webhook endpoints. Feishu/Lark supports webhook ingress or long-connection transport, but interactive callbacks still use a bounded local HTTPS callback path.
- **Allowlist/Trust Model**: Allowlists define trusted senders/channels. Non-allowlisted senders are treated as untrusted (for example, `/run` is approval-routed instead of auto-executed).
- **Strict Profile Gate**: In `public` deployment or `hardened` runtime posture, enabling connector ingress without platform allowlist coverage is fail-closed at startup/deployment checks.
- **Local Secrets**: Bot tokens are stored in your local environment, never sent to ComfyUI.
- **Admin Boundary**: Control-plane actions call admin endpoints on the local OpenClaw server and require connector-side admin token configuration for admin command paths.

### Installation and callback contract baseline

OpenClaw now includes a platform-agnostic baseline for multi-workspace connector lifecycle and interactive callback security:

- installation registry stores normalized records:
  - `platform`, `workspace_id`, `installation_id`, `token_refs`, `status`, `updated_at`
- token material is kept in encrypted server-side secret storage; registry and diagnostics expose token references only
- workspace resolution is fail-closed on missing/ambiguous/inactive/stale bindings
- installation diagnostics can also surface stable health states such as `ok`, `invalid_token`, `revoked`, `workspace_unbound`, and `degraded`
- interactive callback contract enforces signed envelope checks, timestamp window, payload-hash validation, replay/idempotency guardrails, and command-policy mapping (`public`/`run`/`admin`) with explicit force-approval outcomes for untrusted `run` callbacks

Admin diagnostics APIs:

- `GET /openclaw/connector/installations`
- `GET /openclaw/connector/installations/{installation_id}`
- `GET /openclaw/connector/installations/resolve?platform=<platform>&workspace_id=<workspace_id>`
- `GET /openclaw/connector/installations/audit`

Slack multi-workspace notes:

- Slack OAuth installs bind one workspace per installation record and persist only encrypted token refs.
- OAuth callback state is single-use and replay/invalid-state callbacks fail closed instead of reusing a prior install session.
- `GET /openclaw/connector/installations/resolve?platform=slack&workspace_id=<team_id>` returns the fail-closed resolution view for a specific Slack workspace.
- `GET /openclaw/connector/installations` diagnostics may include per-install health metadata plus aggregate `health_counts`.
- Slack lifecycle events such as `tokens_revoked`, `app_uninstalled`, and rate-limit degradation update installation health so outbound replies fail closed or degrade predictably for the affected workspace.
- In multi-workspace mode, outbound replies and delayed result deliveries resolve the bot token by workspace binding and keep Slack thread context when replying back to the originating conversation.

Feishu / Lark notes:

- Feishu bindings can be declared with a single app pair or a multi-account `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_BINDINGS_JSON` manifest; each binding resolves to one normalized installation record with account/workspace identity.
- The connector supports both `feishu` and `lark` API domains through one shared binding contract, so region-specific app hosts do not require a different adapter.
- Websocket-mode Feishu deployments still host a callback route so interactive approval cards and command buttons remain available when message ingress itself is long-connection based.
- Feishu callback actions are signed, replay-guarded, tenant-aware, and deduplicated. Untrusted actors pressing run-affecting buttons are downgraded to approval flow instead of executing directly.

### Multi-tenant boundary behavior

When backend multi-tenant mode is enabled (`OPENCLAW_MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=1`):

- installation records are tenant-owned (`tenant_id`) and diagnostics are tenant-scoped
- resolution rejects cross-tenant matches fail-closed (`tenant_mismatch` path)
- admin diagnostics calls can pass tenant context via token context and/or `X-OpenClaw-Tenant-Id` (or your configured `OPENCLAW_TENANT_HEADER`)
- missing tenant context currently falls back to `default` tenant for compatibility unless stricter caller paths are used

## Supported Platforms

- **Telegram**: Long-polling (instant response).
- **Discord**: Gateway WebSocket (instant response).
- **LINE**: Webhook (requires inbound HTTPS).
- **WhatsApp**: Webhook (requires inbound HTTPS).
- **WeChat Official Account**: Webhook (requires inbound HTTPS).
- **KakaoTalk (Kakao i Open Builder)**: Webhook (requires inbound HTTPS).
- **Slack (Events API)**: Webhook (requires inbound HTTPS).
- **Feishu / Lark**: Webhook or long-connection transport; interactive callbacks require inbound HTTPS for the callback route.

## Setup

### 1. Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `aiohttp` (installed with ComfyUI-OpenClaw)

### 2. Configuration

Set the following environment variables (or put them in a `.env` file if you use a loader):

**Common:**

- `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_URL`: URL of your ComfyUI (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8188`)
- `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_DEBUG`: Set to `1` for verbose logs.
- `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_ADMIN_USERS`: Comma-separated list of user IDs allowed to run admin commands (for example `/stop`, approvals, schedules). Admin users are also treated as trusted senders for `/run`.
- `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_ADMIN_TOKEN`: Admin token sent to OpenClaw (`X-OpenClaw-Admin-Token`).
- `OPENCLAW_LOG_TRUNCATE_ON_START`: Optional backend runtime flag. Set `1` to clear `openclaw.log` once at backend startup to avoid stale-history noise in UI log panels.
- `OPENCLAW_MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED`: Optional backend mode toggle. If `1`, connector diagnostics and installation resolution become tenant-scoped.
- `OPENCLAW_TENANT_HEADER`: Optional tenant header key (default `X-OpenClaw-Tenant-Id`) used when calling tenant-scoped backend APIs.

**Admin token behavior:**

- Connector admin command paths require `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_ADMIN_TOKEN` to be set in connector runtime.
- If the OpenClaw server has `OPENCLAW_ADMIN_TOKEN` configured, `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_ADMIN_TOKEN` must match it or admin calls return HTTP 403.
- Without `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_ADMIN_TOKEN`, admin command flows (`/approve`, `/reject`, `/trace`, schedules) are blocked by connector policy before upstream calls.

**Telegram:**

- `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN`: Your Bot Token (from @BotFather).
- `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`: Comma-separated list of User IDs (e.g. `123456, 789012`).

> **Note:** Media URLs are signed with a secret derived from `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_ADMIN_TOKEN` or a random key.
> To ensure URLs remain valid after connector restarts, **you must set `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_ADMIN_TOKEN`**.
> LINE and WhatsApp also **require** `public_base_url` to be HTTPS.
> WeChat currently supports text-first control. Image/media upload delivery is not implemented in phase 1.
> Kakao currently supports text-first control and quick replies. Rich media delivery is not enabled in the default Kakao webhook flow.
> Slack supports text responses and image uploads (via `files.upload` API).
> Feishu currently supports text replies plus interactive approval/command cards; richer card templates can be added on top of the same signed callback contract.

### Command authorization policy

Connector commands are evaluated through a centralized authorization policy with three command classes:

- `public`: low-risk status/help style commands
- `run`: execution commands such as `/run` (still subject to trust/approval behavior)
- `admin`: sensitive commands such as `/trace`, `/approvals`, `/approve`, `/reject`, and schedule controls

Default behavior:

- If no explicit allow-from list is configured for a command class, class-level defaults apply.
- `admin` commands require the sender to be in `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_ADMIN_USERS`.
- `public` and `run` commands still pass through each platform adapter's trust/allowlist checks.

Optional policy controls:

- `OPENCLAW_COMMAND_OVERRIDES`: JSON object mapping command name to class (`public`, `run`, `admin`).
- `OPENCLAW_COMMAND_ALLOW_FROM_PUBLIC`: comma-separated sender IDs.
- `OPENCLAW_COMMAND_ALLOW_FROM_RUN`: comma-separated sender IDs.
- `OPENCLAW_COMMAND_ALLOW_FROM_ADMIN`: comma-separated sender IDs.

Normalization rules:

- Command keys in `OPENCLAW_COMMAND_OVERRIDES` are normalized to lowercase.
- Missing leading `/` is added automatically.

Example:

```bash
OPENCLAW_COMMAND_OVERRIDES='{"run":"admin","/status":"public"}'
OPENCLAW_COMMAND_ALLOW_FROM_ADMIN=alice_id,bob_id
OPENCLAW_COMMAND_ALLOW_FROM_RUN=alice_id,ops_bot_id
```

If a class-level `OPENCLAW_COMMAND_ALLOW_FROM_*` list is set and non-empty, only listed IDs can run that class.

### 3. Usage

#### Running the Connector

```bash
python -m connector
```

#### LINE Webhook Setup

Unlike Telegram/Discord which pull messages, LINE pushes webhooks to your connector.
Since the connector runs on `localhost` (default port 8099), you must expose it to the internet securely.

**Option A: Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended)**

1. Install `cloudflared`.
2. Run: `cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:8099`
3. Copy the generated URL (e.g. `https://random-name.trycloudflare.com`).
4. In LINE Developers Console > Messaging API > Webhook settings:
   - Set URL to `https://<your-tunnel>/line/webhook` (or your custom path).
   - Enable "Use webhook".

**Option B: Reverse Proxy (Nginx/Caddy)**

- Configure your proxy to forward HTTPS traffic to `127.0.0.1:8099`.

#### WhatsApp Webhook Setup

WhatsApp Cloud API delivers webhooks to your connector. You must expose it via HTTPS.

1. Create a Meta app and add the WhatsApp product.
2. Add a phone number and note its **Phone Number ID**.
3. Configure the webhook URL: `https://<your-public-host>/whatsapp/webhook`.
4. Set the webhook **Verify Token** to match `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`.
5. Subscribe to `messages` events.
6. Ensure `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is an HTTPS URL so media can be delivered.

If you run locally, use a secure tunnel (Cloudflare Tunnel or ngrok) and point it to `http://127.0.0.1:8098`.

#### WeChat Official Account Webhook Setup (Detailed)

WeChat Official Account pushes webhook requests to your connector. You must expose the WeChat endpoint publicly over HTTPS.

1. Prepare the required environment variables:

   ```bash
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_WECHAT_TOKEN=replace-with-your-wechat-token
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_WECHAT_APP_ID=wx1234567890abcdef
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_WECHAT_APP_SECRET=replace-with-app-secret
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_WECHAT_ALLOWED_USERS=openid_1,openid_2
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_WECHAT_BIND=127.0.0.1
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_WECHAT_PORT=8097
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_WECHAT_PATH=/wechat/webhook
   ```

2. Start the connector:

   ```bash
   python -m connector
   ```

3. Expose the local webhook service to HTTPS (Cloudflare Tunnel or reverse proxy):
   - local upstream: `http://127.0.0.1:8097`
   - public path: `/wechat/webhook`
   - expected public URL: `https://<your-public-host>/wechat/webhook`

4. In WeChat Official Account backend (Developer settings / server config), configure:
   - URL: `https://<your-public-host>/wechat/webhook`
   - Token: same value as `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_WECHAT_TOKEN`
   - EncodingAESKey: set according to your WeChat backend requirement
   - Message encryption mode: use plaintext/compatible mode for this adapter path

5. Save/submit server config. WeChat will call your endpoint with verification query parameters.
   - expected success behavior: connector returns `echostr` and logs verification success
   - expected failure behavior: `403 Verification failed` if token/signature mismatches

6. Functional test:
   - follow your Official Account with a test user
   - send `/help` or `/status`
   - verify connector receives command and returns text reply

7. Verify trusted/untrusted behavior:
   - if sender OpenID is in `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_WECHAT_ALLOWED_USERS`, `/run` can execute directly (subject to trust/approval policy and command policy)
   - if not allowlisted, sensitive actions are routed to approval flow

**WeChat-specific notes:**

- The adapter validates WeChat signature on every request and applies replay/timestamp checks.
- Timestamp skew outside policy window is rejected (`403 Stale Request`).
- XML payload parsing is bounded (size/depth/field caps) and fails closed on parser budget violations.
- Runtime XML security gate is fail-closed: unsafe/missing parser baseline blocks ingress startup.
- Current command surface is text-first. Unsupported message/event types are ignored with success response.
- Proactive outbound API messaging requires both `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_WECHAT_APP_ID` and `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_WECHAT_APP_SECRET`.

#### KakaoTalk (Kakao i Open Builder) Webhook Setup (Detailed)

Kakao i Open Builder sends webhook requests to your connector Skill endpoint. You must expose the Kakao endpoint publicly over HTTPS.

1. Prepare the required environment variables:

   ```bash
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_ENABLED=true
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_ALLOWED_USERS=kakao_user_id_1,kakao_user_id_2
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_BIND=127.0.0.1
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_PORT=8096
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_PATH=/kakao/webhook
   ```

2. Start the connector:

   ```bash
   python -m connector
   ```

3. Expose the local webhook service to HTTPS (Cloudflare Tunnel or reverse proxy):
   - local upstream: `http://127.0.0.1:8096`
   - public path: `/kakao/webhook`
   - expected public URL: `https://<your-public-host>/kakao/webhook`

4. In Kakao i Open Builder:
   - create/select your bot
   - create/select a Skill
   - set Skill server URL to `https://<your-public-host>/kakao/webhook`
   - deploy/publish the Skill scenario that calls this Skill endpoint

5. Functional test:
   - chat with your Kakao bot
   - send `/help` or `/status`
   - verify connector receives command and returns a SkillResponse (`version: 2.0`)

6. Verify trusted/untrusted behavior:
   - if sender `userRequest.user.id` is in `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_ALLOWED_USERS`, `/run` can execute directly (subject to trust/approval policy and command policy)
   - if not allowlisted, sensitive actions are routed to approval flow

7. Optional first-time allowlist bootstrap:
   - temporarily leave `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_ALLOWED_USERS` empty
   - send a test message and check logs for `Untrusted Kakao message from user=<id>`
   - add that ID to allowlist and restart connector

**Kakao-specific notes:**

- Adapter is disabled unless `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_ENABLED=true`.
- Kakao webhook ingress is `POST` only on `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_PATH`.
- Replay protection is enabled: identical payloads within the replay window are acknowledged and not re-executed.
- Kakao command requests are normalized from:
  - `userRequest.user.id` -> `sender_id`
  - `userRequest.utterance` -> command text
- Response format follows Kakao SkillResponse v2.0 with text-first output and optional quick replies.
- If `aiohttp` is missing, the adapter is skipped at startup.

#### Slack Webhook Setup (Detailed)

Slack uses the Events API webhook mode in OpenClaw. You must expose the endpoint publicly over HTTPS.

1. **Create the Slack App**
   - Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps).
   - Create a new app (From scratch) and select your workspace.
   - In **Basic Information**, copy the **Signing Secret**.

2. **Configure OAuth Scopes and install**
   - Go to **OAuth & Permissions**.
   - Add bot scopes:
     - `chat:write`
     - `files:write`
     - `app_mentions:read`
     - `im:history` (DM support)
     - `channels:history` (public channel messages)
     - `groups:history` (private channel messages)
   - For legacy single-workspace mode, click **Install to Workspace** and copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`).
   - For F58 multi-workspace mode, configure a redirect URL and let OpenClaw handle installs through its OAuth routes.

3. **Configure connector environment variables**

   ```bash
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_CLIENT_ID=1234567890.1234567890
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=replace-with-client-secret
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-public-host
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_OAUTH_INSTALL_PATH=/slack/install
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PATH=/slack/oauth/callback
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS=U12345,U67890
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_ALLOWED_CHANNELS=C12345
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_BIND=127.0.0.1
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_PORT=8095
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_PATH=/slack/events
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_REQUIRE_MENTION=true
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_REPLY_IN_THREAD=true
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_ADMIN_TOKEN=replace-with-openclaw-admin-token
   ```

   Notes:
   - Legacy single-workspace fallback can still set `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...`; F58 multi-workspace mode no longer requires that token at startup if OAuth install flow is configured.
   - `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_ADMIN_TOKEN` must match server `OPENCLAW_ADMIN_TOKEN` if server-side admin token is enabled.
   - Slack ingress is fail-closed: invalid/missing signature, stale timestamp, and replayed events are rejected.
   - OAuth callbacks also fail closed on invalid or replayed `state` values.

4. **Start connector and expose webhook endpoint**
   - Start connector: `python -m connector`
   - Expose local endpoint to public HTTPS (Cloudflare Tunnel/ngrok/reverse proxy):
     - local upstream: `http://127.0.0.1:8095`
     - public URL: `https://<public-host>/slack/events`
     - install URL: `https://<public-host>/slack/install`
     - callback URL: `https://<public-host>/slack/oauth/callback`

5. **Enable Event Subscriptions**
   - Go to **Event Subscriptions** and enable events.
   - Set **Request URL** to `https://<public-host>/slack/events`.
   - Slack sends `url_verification`; connector responds automatically.
   - Add bot events:
     - `app_mention`
     - `message.channels`
     - `message.groups`
     - `message.im`

6. **Invite and validate**
   - Open `https://<public-host>/slack/install` and complete the workspace install.
   - Invite the app to target channels: `/invite @YourBot`.
   - In channel: `@YourBot /status` (when `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_REQUIRE_MENTION=true`).
   - In DM: `/help`.
   - Verify connector logs show signed ingress accepted and replies delivered.
   - Verify `GET /openclaw/connector/installations` shows the Slack workspace binding and health state `ok`.
   - If you test uninstall/token-revoke scenarios, verify the installation health flips to `revoked` or `invalid_token` and that subsequent replies for that workspace fail closed until reinstalled.

7. **Security checklist before production**
   - Keep `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS`/`OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_ALLOWED_CHANNELS` restricted.
   - Keep `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_REQUIRE_MENTION=true` unless intentionally running command-style channels.
   - Rotate Slack signing secret and OAuth client secret on incident response.
   - Do not expose connector without HTTPS termination.

#### Slack Socket Mode Setup (Optional)

Use Socket Mode when you cannot expose a public HTTPS webhook endpoint.

1. **Enable Socket Mode in Slack**
   - Open your Slack App settings.
   - Go to **Socket Mode** and enable it.
   - Create an App-Level Token (`xapp-...`) with `connections:write`.

2. **Configure connector**

   ```bash
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_MODE=socket
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-token
   # Signing secret remains required for parity/security checks.
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret
   # Either configure legacy single-workspace token...
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-token
   # ...or configure multi-workspace OAuth install flow:
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_CLIENT_ID=1234567890.1234567890
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=replace-with-client-secret
   ```

3. **Start connector**
   - `python -m connector`
   - Expect log: `Slack Socket Mode connected.`

Notes:
- Socket Mode uses outbound WebSocket, so `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_BIND`, `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_PORT`, and `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_PATH` are ignored in this mode.
- Startup is fail-closed if `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_APP_TOKEN` is missing or does not start with `xapp-`.
- In multi-workspace mode, outbound replies still resolve the workspace-specific bot token from the installation registry even though the WebSocket connection itself uses the app-level token.

#### Feishu / Lark Setup (Detailed)

Feishu support can run in either long-connection (`websocket`) mode or webhook mode. Long-connection is usually the simpler default for message ingress, but interactive cards still need a reachable callback route if you want approval buttons and other signed actions.

1. **Create the Feishu or Lark app**
   - Create a bot app in the Feishu or Lark developer console.
   - Record the `App ID` and `App Secret`.
   - If you want webhook ingress, also configure the event subscription verification token.
   - If encrypted event delivery is enabled, record the encrypt key as well.

2. **Choose transport mode**
   - `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_MODE=websocket`
     - Uses long connection for message ingress.
     - Recommended when you do not want to expose the event route publicly.
   - `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_MODE=webhook`
     - Uses HTTPS webhook delivery for messages.
     - Requires a public HTTPS route for `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_PATH`.

3. **Configure the default binding**

   ```bash
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_APP_ID=cli_xxx
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_APP_SECRET=sec_xxx
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_ACCOUNT_ID=acct-default
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID=acct-default
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_WORKSPACE_ID=tenant-alpha
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_WORKSPACE_NAME="Alpha Workspace"
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_DOMAIN=feishu
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_MODE=websocket
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_ALLOWED_USERS=ou_xxx,ou_yyy
   OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_ALLOWED_CHATS=oc_xxx,oc_yyy
   ```

4. **Optional: multi-account binding manifest**
   - Use `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_BINDINGS_JSON` when one connector runtime should host more than one Feishu/Lark app or workspace binding.
   - Each entry may include:
     - `account_id`
     - `app_id`
     - `app_secret`
     - `workspace_id`
     - `workspace_name`
     - `verification_token`
     - `encrypt_key`
     - `domain`
     - `mode`

5. **Configure interactive callback ingress**
   - Set `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to your public HTTPS origin.
   - Expose `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_CALLBACK_PATH` (default `/feishu/callback`) through your reverse proxy or tunnel.
   - In long-connection mode this callback route is still required for interactive approval cards; message ingress transport does not remove callback security requirements.

6. **Start connector**
   - `python -m connector`
   - Expect logs showing the chosen Feishu mode and callback/event route bindings.

7. **Verify runtime behavior**
   - Run `/status` from an allowlisted Feishu/Lark user.
   - Run `/approvals` and confirm the reply renders approval buttons as an interactive card.
   - Click `Approve` or `Reject` on a test approval and verify the callback succeeds once, then duplicate clicks are deduped.

Notes:
- `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_DOMAIN=lark` switches outbound API host behavior without changing the rest of the connector contract.
- Untrusted users can still see bounded command responses, but run-affecting interactive actions are downgraded to approval flow instead of auto-executing.
- Callback signing secrets are resolved from the bound Feishu installation record; diagnostics expose binding state, not raw secret material.

## Commands

**General:**

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/status` | Check ComfyUI system status, logs, and queue size. |
| `/jobs` | View active jobs and queue summary. |
| `/history <id>` | View details of a finished job. |
| `/help` | Show available commands. |
| `/run <template> [k=v] [--approval]` | Submit a job. Use `--approval` to request approval gate instead of creating job immediately. |
| `/stop` | **Global Interrupt**: Stop all running generations. |

**Admin Only:**
*(Requires User ID in `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_ADMIN_USERS`)*

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/trace <id>` | View raw execution logs/trace for a job. |
| `/approvals` | List pending approvals. |
| `/approve <id>` | Approve a pending request (triggers execution immediately). |
| `/reject <id> [reason]` | Reject a workflow. |
| `/schedules` | List schedules. |
| `/schedule run <id>` | Trigger a schedule immediately. |

## Usage Examples

### Approval Gated Run

1. **Submission (Admin)**:

   ```
   User: /run my-template steps=20 --approval
   Bot:  [Approval Requested]
         ID: apr_12345
         Trace: ...
         Expires: 2026-02-07T12:00:00Z
   ```

2. **Approval (Admin)**:

   ```
   User: /approve apr_12345
   Bot:  [Approved] apr_12345
         Executed: p_98765
   ```

### Common Failure Modes

- **(Not Executed)**:
  - If `/approve` returns `[Approved] ... (Not Executed)`, it means the request state was updated to Approved, but the job could not be autostarted.
  - **Reason**: Backend might lack a submit handler for this trigger type, or `auto_execute` failed. Check `openclaw` server logs.
  - **Action**: Manually run the job using the template/inputs from the approval request.

- **Access Denied**:
  - Sender is not in `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_ADMIN_USERS`.
  - Fix: Add ID to `.env` and restart connector.

- **HTTP 403 (Admin Token)**:
  - Connector has the right user allowlist, but the upstream OpenClaw server rejected the Admin Token.
  - Fix: Ensure `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_ADMIN_TOKEN` matches the server's `OPENCLAW_ADMIN_TOKEN`.

- **Kakao requests not arriving**:
  - `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_ENABLED` is not `true`, or Kakao Skill URL/path does not match `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_PATH`.
  - Fix: set `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_ENABLED=true`, verify public HTTPS URL, and confirm Skill URL exactly matches `/kakao/webhook` (or your custom path).

- **Kakao returns empty/fallback response**:
  - Payload is malformed (missing `userRequest.user.id` / `userRequest.utterance`) or the adapter rejected malformed JSON.
  - Fix: validate Skill request payload shape in Open Builder test console and check connector logs for `Bad JSON` / payload errors.

- **Kakao `/run` always goes to approval**:
  - Sender is not in `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_ALLOWED_USERS` (or allowlist is empty).
  - Fix: capture `userRequest.user.id` from logs, add it to `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_KAKAO_ALLOWED_USERS`, restart connector.

- **Slack Event Subscriptions verification fails**:
  - Request URL/path mismatch, connector not reachable, or `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` is wrong.
  - Fix: confirm public URL points to `/slack/events`, verify tunnel/proxy routes to `127.0.0.1:8095`, and re-check Signing Secret.

- **Slack commands ignored in channels**:
  - `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_REQUIRE_MENTION=true` and message does not mention the bot.
  - Fix: mention bot explicitly (`@Bot /status`) or set `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_SLACK_REQUIRE_MENTION=false` if policy allows.

- **Feishu callback buttons fail with signature or stale-action errors**:
  - Callback route is not using the same bound app secret, request arrived too late, or the button payload was replayed.
  - Fix: verify binding diagnostics, public callback route, connector clock, and that the same action is not being resent by proxy/retry middleware.

- **Feishu long-connection messages work but card actions do nothing**:
  - `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_CALLBACK_PATH` is not exposed publicly, or the callback URL is not routed to the connector bind host/port.
  - Fix: expose the callback route over HTTPS even when `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_MODE=websocket`.

- **Feishu `/run` action becomes approval instead of executing immediately**:
  - Callback actor is untrusted under current allowlist/policy mapping.
  - Fix: add the user/chat to `OPENCLAW_CONNECTOR_FEISHU_ALLOWED_USERS` or `_ALLOWED_CHATS`, or keep the approval downgrade as the intended posture.
